Java Selenium TestNG Automation Framework:-

This is a simple, reusable test automation framework using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and WebDriverManager.  
It supports test case writing, data-driven testing, and automatic screenshot capture for failed test cases.


Tech Stack:-

- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- WebDriverManager
- Maven

How to Run:-

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Import into Eclipse or IntelliJ as a Maven project.
3. Right-click on `testng.xml` → Run As → TestNG Suite.
4. Test cases will execute in the browser.
5. On test failure, screenshots will be saved in the `screenshots/` folder.

Writing Your Own Test Cases:-

- Go to `tests/TestScriptsClass.java`
- Write your test methods with `@Test`
- You can use data from `DataProviderClass` if needed
- Tests will automatically use the base setup and listeners

Notes:-

- Screenshot capture works only for **failed** tests.
- Make sure browser drivers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) are managed via WebDriverManager.
- Application URL is set in `BaseClass.java`.
